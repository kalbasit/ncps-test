# ncps: Nix Cache Proxy Server

ncps is a proxy server that speeds up Nix dependency retrieval on your local network. It acts as a local binary cache for Nix, fetching store paths from upstream caches (like cache.nixos.org) and storing them locally. This reduces download times and bandwidth usage, especially when multiple machines share the same dependencies.

## Problem it Solves

When multiple machines running NixOS or Nix pull packages, they often download the same dependencies from remote caches like `cache.nixos.org`. This leads to:

- **Redundant downloads:** Each machine downloads the same files.
- **Increased bandwidth usage:** Potentially significant network traffic, especially for large projects.
- **Slower build times:** Waiting for downloads slows down development and deployments.

ncps addresses these issues by acting as a central cache on your local network.

## How it Works

1. **Request:** A Nix client configured to use ncps requests a store path.
1. **Check Local Cache:** ncps checks if the path is already cached locally. If found, it serves the path directly.
1. **Fetch from Upstream:** If the path is not found locally, ncps fetches it from the configured upstream caches (e.g., cache.nixos.org).
1. **Cache and Sign:** ncps stores the downloaded path in its local cache **and signs it with its own private key**, ensuring that all served paths have valid signatures from both the upstream cache and ncps.
1. **Serve to Client:** ncps serves the downloaded path to the requesting Nix client.

## Features

- **Easy setup:** ncps is easy to configure and run.
- **Multiple upstream caches:** Support for multiple upstream caches for redundancy and flexibility.
- **Reduced bandwidth usage:** Minimizes redundant downloads, saving bandwidth and time.
- **Improved build times:** Faster access to dependencies speeds up builds.
- **Secure caching:** ncps signs cached paths with its own key, ensuring integrity and authenticity.
- **Cache size management:** Configure a maximum cache size and a cron schedule to automatically remove least recently used (LRU) store paths, preventing the cache from growing indefinitely.
- **Zstandard compression support:** ncps supports storing NAR files compressed with Zstandard (zstd) as provided by upstream caches like [Harmonia](https://github.com/nix-community/harmonia). It adjusts the `narinfo` metadata accordingly to reflect the correct filesize and compression method.
- **OpenTelemetry logging:** Forward logs to an OpenTelemetry collector for centralized logging and monitoring.

This flag can be used multiple times, once for each upstream cache. (Environment variable: `$UPSTREAM_PUBLIC_KEYS`)

## Nix Configuration

To configure Nix/NixOS, you need the public key generated by ncps. You can retrieve the public key from `http://<ncps-hostname>/pubkey`.

On your NixOS or Nix clients, you need to configure Nix to use ncps as a binary cache.

**On NixOS**, you can configure these settings in your `configuration.nix` file using the `nix.settings` option, like this:

```nix
nix.settings.substituters = [
  "http://ncps-hostname" // https if ncps is behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS support; You may also need to specify a port.
  // ... other substituters
];

nix.settings.trusted-public-keys = [
  "ncps-hostname=<download-ncps-public-key>"
  "cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY="
  // ... other keys, and the public key of your ncps server
];
```

**On non-NixOS**, this involves two steps:

1. **Add ncps to `substituters`:**

   - In your `nix.conf` file (usually located at `/etc/nix/nix.conf` or `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`), add the URL of your ncps server to the `substituters` list. This tells Nix to try fetching store paths from ncps.

   ```
   substituters = http://ncps-hostname ... other substituters
   ```

1. **Add ncps public key to `trusted-public-keys`:**

   - Add the public key of your ncps server to the `trusted-public-keys` list in your `nix.conf`. This allows Nix to verify the signatures generated by ncps for cached store paths.

   ```
   trusted-public-keys = ncps-hostname-<download-ncps-public-key> ... other keys
   ```
