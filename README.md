## What is ncps?

ncps acts as a local binary cache for Nix, fetching store paths from upstream caches (like cache.nixos.org) and storing them locally. This reduces download times and bandwidth usage, especially beneficial when multiple machines share the same dependencies.

## Key Features

- **Multi-upstream cache** with automatic failover
- **Flexible storage**: local filesystem or S3-compatible (AWS S3, MinIO, etc.)
- **Database support**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL/MariaDB
- **High availability** with Redis distributed locking for zero-downtime deployments
- **Smart caching**: LRU management with configurable size limits
- **Secure signing**: Signs cached paths with private keys for integrity
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry and Prometheus metrics support
- **Easy setup**: Simple configuration and deployment

## ⚠️ Development Status & Data Safety

> [!important]
> **Production Warning**: The main branch and pre-release versions are under active development and should never be used in production. Your data may be lost or corrupted! Always use the [latest release](https://github.com/kalbasit/ncps/releases/latest) for production environments.
>
> **Early Stage Notice**: ncps is in early development and data consistency/recovery is not guaranteed. Please maintain regular backups of your data, especially when updating ncps versions.

## Quick Start

Get ncps running in minutes with Docker:

```bash
# Pull images and create storage
docker pull alpine && docker pull ghcr.io/kalbasit/ncps
docker volume create ncps-storage
docker run --rm -v ncps-storage:/storage alpine /bin/sh -c \
  "mkdir -m 0755 -p /storage/var && mkdir -m 0700 -p /storage/var/ncps && mkdir -m 0700 -p /storage/var/ncps/db"

# Initialize database
docker run --rm -v ncps-storage:/storage ghcr.io/kalbasit/ncps \
  /bin/dbmate --url=sqlite:/storage/var/ncps/db/db.sqlite up

# Start the server
docker run -d --name ncps -p 8501:8501 -v ncps-storage:/storage ghcr.io/kalbasit/ncps \
  /bin/ncps serve \
  --cache-hostname=your-ncps-hostname \
  --cache-storage-local=/storage \
  --cache-database-url=sqlite:/storage/var/ncps/db/db.sqlite \
  --cache-upstream-url=https://cache.nixos.org \
  --cache-upstream-public-key=cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
```

Your cache will be available at `http://localhost:8501`. See the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.ncps.dev/user-guide/getting-started/quick-start.html) for more options including S3 storage.
